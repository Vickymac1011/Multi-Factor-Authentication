# Multi-Factor-Authentication

 A Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before granting access to a system, application, or online account. It adds an extra layer of protection beyond just a username and password, which are typically vulnerable to hacking through techniques like phishing or brute force attacks.

 Key Features of 2FA include:

                     *  Multiple Verification Methods.

                     *  Customizable Security Policies.

                     *  User Self-Service.
